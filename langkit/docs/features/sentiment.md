# Sentiment Analysis

The use of sentiment analysis for monitoring Language Model (LLM) applications can provide valuable insights into the appropriateness and user engagement of generated responses. By employing sentiment and toxicity classifiers, we can assess the sentiment and detect potentially harmful or inappropriate content within LLM outputs.

Monitoring sentiment allows us to gauge the overall tone and emotional impact of the responses. By analyzing sentiment scores, we can ensure that the LLM is consistently generating appropriate and contextually relevant responses. For instance, in customer service applications, maintaining a positive sentiment ensures a satisfactory user experience.

Additionally, toxicity analysis provides an important measure of the presence of offensive, disrespectful, or harmful language in LLM outputs. By monitoring toxicity scores, we can identify potentially inappropriate content and take necessary actions to mitigate any negative impact.

Analyzing sentiment and toxicity scores in LLM applications also serves other motivations. It enables us to identify potential biases or controversial opinions present in the responses, helping to address concerns related to fairness, inclusivity, and ethical considerations.
